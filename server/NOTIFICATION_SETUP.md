# Notification System Setup

This hairstylist booking system includes automated email and SMS notifications for appointments. The SMS functionality is completely optional and the system will work perfectly without it.

## Required Setup (Email)

### 1. Email Service Configuration

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (Required)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail  # or 'outlook', 'yahoo', etc.
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Admin Contact (Required for admin notifications)
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
```

**Note:** For Gmail, you'll need to use an "App Password" instead of your regular password. Enable 2-factor authentication and generate an app password in your Google Account settings.

## Optional Setup (SMS)

### 2. SMS Service Configuration (Optional)

If you want SMS notifications, add these environment variables:

```env
# SMS Configuration (Optional - Twilio)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number

# Admin Phone (Optional - for admin SMS notifications)
ADMIN_PHONE=+1234567890
```

**Important:** The system will work perfectly without SMS configuration. SMS notifications are completely optional.
